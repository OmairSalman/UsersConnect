## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict type checking
- Avoid using `any` type when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types alongside implementations

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings (except for template literals)
- Use semicolons
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Updates a user's profile information
 * @param userId - The unique identifier of the user
 * @param userData - The updated user data
 * @returns The updated user object or an error message
 */
async updateUser(userId: string, userData: UpdateUserDto): Promise<PublicUser | string> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: camelCase for TypeScript files (e.g., `userService.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`)
- **Functions/Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `getUserById`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with 'I' prefix optional (e.g., `UserPayload`)

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

- Add forgot password endpoint
- Implement email sending for reset links
- Add password reset token validation

Closes #123
```

```
fix(posts): resolve like count synchronization issue

The like count was not updating correctly when users
rapidly liked/unliked posts. This fix implements
optimistic locking to prevent race conditions.

Fixes #456
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Update tests when modifying existing code
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for business logic
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  let userService: UserService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    userService = new UserService();
  });

  describe('getUserById', () => {
    it('should return user data for valid ID', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      
      // Act
      const result = await userService.getUserById(userId);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(result._id).toBe(userId);
    });

    it('should return null for non-existent user', async () => {
      const result = await userService.getUserById('invalid-id');
      expect(result).toBeNull();
    });
  });
});
```

## Database Migrations

When making changes to the database schema:

1. Create a migration file in TypeORM
2. Test the migration locally
3. Document any breaking changes
4. Update the relevant model entities

```bash
npm run typeorm migration:create -- -n YourMigrationName
```

## Documentation

* Keep README.md up to date
* Document all public APIs
* Add JSDoc comments to functions
* Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes
